# Breathscape VR

This project was developed for my PAP at Col√©gio de Gaia.

Breathscape VR is a virtual reality application designed to promote relaxation through auditory and visually guided breathing exercises.

This project also includes the backoffice and a website I made for the application, check the folder "EXTRA".
